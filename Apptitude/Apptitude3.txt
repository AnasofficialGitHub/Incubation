1) Three years ago, the average age of Anita, Priya, and Varsha was 27 years. If five years ago, the average age of Priya and Varsha was 20 years, find the present age of Anita.

30
40
60
25
Answer: B

Explanation:
Sum of the present ages of Anita, Priya and Varsha = (27 x 3 + 3 x 3) years = 90 years.
Sum of the present ages of Priya and Varsha = (20 x 2 + 5 x 2) years = 50 years.
Anita's present age = (90 - 50) years = 40 years.

Play Video


167
213
350
437
Hide Answer Workspace
The Correct answer is (A)

Answer with explanation:

Step 1: Find a whole number 'X' for each number such that X2 > the number;

132 > 167

152 > 213

192 > 350

212 > 437

Step 2: Get all the prime numbers which are less than 'X'.

Prime numbers less than 13 are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11

Prime numbers less than 15 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13

Prime numbers less than 19 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17

Prime numbers less than 21 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19

Step 3: Check divisibility of each number with prime numbers which are less than 'X'.

167 is not divisible by any prime number

213 is divisible by 3

352 is divisible by 2 and 11

437 is divisible by 19

∴167 is the required prime number as it is not divisible by any prime number.

3) A, B, and C invest 63000, 56000, and 84000 respectively to start a business. After one year, the profit is distributed in the ratio of their investments. If C's share of profit is Rs.54000, find the total profit earned.

135030
130500
145000
None of these
Answer: B

Explanation:

Let the total profit = x
The ratio of investment = 63000: 56000: 84000
=63:56:84
On dividing by 7, we get 9:8:12
Now, sum of the ratios = 29

Apply formula:
C's share = (C's ratio/ sum of all three ratios)* total profit
C's share = (12/29) * x = 54000
x= (54000*29)/12
x= 130500

Hence, the total profit = 130500

4) A motorboat travels 16 km in 2 hours against the flow of river and travels next 8 km along the flow of the river in 20 minutes. How long will it take motorboat to travel 48 km in still water?

2.5 hours
3 hours
3.5 hours
4 hours
Hide Answer Workspace
The correct answer is B

Answer with the explanation:

Speed = Apti Boat and streams 57

Speed upstream = Apti Boat and streams 58 = 8 km/hr

Speed downstream = Apti Boat and streams 59 = Apti Boat and streams 60 = 24 km/hr

∴ Speed in still water = Apti Boat and streams 61 (speed downstream +speed upstream)

= Apti Boat and streams 62 (24+8)=16 km/hr

Required time = Apti Boat and streams 63

= Apti Boat and streams 64 =3 hour

5) There are two towers. The first tower of height 60 m casts a shadow of length 100m. At the same time if the second tower casts a shadow of length 140 m, find its height?

80 m
84 m
88 m
90 m
Hide Answer Workspace
The Correctoption is(B)

Answer with explanation:

Apti Height and distance55
Let the height of the second tower = X

We know that the length of the shadow is directly proportional to the height of the tower.

Apti Height and distance56
X = 84 m (Option B)

6) The profit percent gained if an object is sold at Rs 464 is equals to the loss percent when the object is sold at Rs 436. Find the cost price of this object?

250
400
450
500
Hide Answer Workspace
Answer: C

Explanation:

Apply formula:

Profit = selling price - cost price
Loss = cost price - selling price

ATQ, Selling price in case of profit is 464
Selling price in case of loss is 436

And the loss % = profit %

So, cost price - selling price = selling price - cost price
Let cost price = x

x- 436 = 464 - x
2x= 464+436
2x = 900
x = 450

8) 3 workers can do a piece of work in 20 days. If one of them works only for half time in a day, in how many days the work will be done?

24 days
20 days
22 days
23 days
Hide Answer Workspace
The Correct answer is (A)

Explanation:

3 men's one day work = 1
                                  20

One man works for half day, so his one day's work = 1    =    1
                                                                          60∗2      120

Sum of each man one day's work = 1    +    1   +    1    =    5   =   1
                                                   60          60       120      120    24

Therefore, they will do the work in 24 days

10) Out of 7 constants and 4 vowels, how many words of 3 constants and 2 vowels can be formed?

21020
25200
10500
21400
Answer: B

Answer with the explanation:

We can combine 3 consonants and 2 vowels out of 7 consonants and 4 vowels in a way

7C3 * 4C2 = Apti Permutation and Combination = 210

That means 210 groups having 3 consonants and 2 vowels.

Each group consists of 5 words that mean the possible arrangement of the letters is 5!

Or, 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120 ways.

Therefore, the required number of words = 210*120 = 25200.
