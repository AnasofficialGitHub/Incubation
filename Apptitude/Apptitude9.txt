2.Excluding stoppages, the speed of a bus is 54 kmph and including stoppages, it is 45 kmph. For how many minutes does the bus stop per hour?
A. 10
B. 9
C. 8
D. 7

Hint: Calculate the distance travelled by bus in 1 hour excluding stoppages. Then calculate the distance travelled by bus in 1 hour including stoppages.
After this find the difference between the distances travelled including and excluding the stoppages. Then calculate the time taken to cover that “difference of the distances calculated above” and convert the calculated time into minutes.
Complete step-by-step answer:
It is given that, excluding stoppages, the speed of a bus is 54 kmph.
⇒ Distance travelled by bus in 1 hour, excluding stoppages = 54 km.
Also, it is given that including stoppages the speed of the bus is 45 km/hr.
⇒ Distance travelled by the bus in 1 hour, including stoppages = 45 km.
(Distance travelled by bus in 1 hour excluding stoppages – distance travelled by bus in 1 hour including stoppages)
⇒(54km−45km)⇒9km
That means, due to stoppages, the bus covers 9 km less.
Hence, time taken to cover 9 km,
=distance travelledspeed of the bus
It is given usual speed of the bus = 54 km/hour
∴ Time taken to cover 9 km =9km54km/hour
=16hour
Time taken in minutes =(16×60)minutes
=10minutes
(Since, 1 hour = 60 minutes)
Therefore, the bus stops per hour for 10 minutes.
Hence, option A is correct.
Note: Students can easily solve this question by using this trick.
Required time for the stoppage per hour,
=difference of speedsspeed without stoppage=(54−4554)hour⇒954=16=(16×60)minutes(since 1 hour = 60 minutes)=10minutes

3.In a flight of 600 km, an aircraft was slowed down due to bad weather. Its average speed for the trip was reduced by 200 km/hr and the time of flight increased by 30 minutes. What is the duration of the flight?
Answer:

Given:

Total distance = 600 km
Average speed reduced = 200km/hr.
Time of flight increased = 30 minutes
Average speed = Total distance/Time

Let us consider

The original duration of flight = T hr.

∴ Original average speed = 600/T

Since the speed of the tripe was reduced by 200km and the time of flight increased by 0.5 hr.(30 minutes).

Reduced average speed = (600/T) – 200
New duration of flight = (T + 0.5 hr.)
New average speed = 600/(T + 0.5 hr.)
Equating we get

600/T – 200 = 600/(T + 0.5)

3/T – 1 = 3/(T + 0.5)

3 – T/T = 3/(T + 0.5)

T2 + 0.5T – 1.5 = 0

2T2 + T – 3 = 0

2T2 – 2T+ 3T – 3 = 0

2T(T – 1) + 3(T – 1) = 0

(T – 1)(2T + 3) = 0

T = 1 hr.

4.A man complete a journey in 10 hours. He travels first half of the journey at the rate of 21 km/hr and second half at the rate of 24 km/hr. Find the total journey in km.
A.220 km
B.224 km
C.230 km
D.234 km
Answer: Option B

5.A, B, C enter into a partnership with shares in the ratio 7/2 : 4/3 : 6/5 After 4 months, A increases his share by 50%. If the total profit at the end of one year is Rs 21600, then B's share in the profit is :

A.Rs 2100
B.Rs 2400
C.Rs 3600
D.Rs 4000
E.None of these
Solution
The correct option is D Rs 4000

6.A, B, C subscribe Rs. 50,000 for a business. A subscribes Rs. 4000 more than B and B Rs. 5000 more than C. Out of a total profit of Rs. 35,000, A receives:

Correct option is D)
Let C=x.
Then, B=x+5000 and A=x+5000+4000=x+9000.
So, x+x+5000+x+9000=50000
⇒3x=36000
⇒x=12000
A:B:C=21000:17000:12000=21:17:12.
∴ A's share = Rs. (35000× 21/50)= Rs. 14,700.

7.Three partners shared the profit in a business in the ratio 5:7:8. They had partnered for 14 months, 8 months and 7 months respectively. What was the ratio of their investments?

Correct option is B)
20:49:64.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.A and B started a partnership business investing some amount in the ratio of 3:5 ,C joined them after six months with an amount equal to that of B In what proportion should the profit at the end of one year be distributed among A,BandC?

Correct option is C -> 6:10:5)
Let the initial investments of A and B be 3x and 5x.
So the investment of C is also 5x
So the ratio of profits distributed among them is given by, 
A:B:C=(3x×12):(5x×12):(5x×6)
A:B:C=36:60:30
A:B:C=6:10:5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9.A and B started a business in partnership investing  Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 15,000 respectively. After six months, C joined them with Rs. 20,000. What will be B's share in the total profit of Rs. 25,000 earned at the end of 2 years from the starting of the business?

Correct option is A.7500)
A's share=20000×24=480000
B's share=15000×24=360000
C's share=20000×18=360000
Ratio of A,B,C 's share=480000:360000:360000
                                     =48:36:36
                                     =4:3:3
Totalratio=4+3+3=10
B's share=

10.The reflex angle between the hands of the clock at 10:25 is.

Correct option is D. 197.5)
Angle traced minutes hand in 25 minutes =  
60
25×360
​
 =150 
∘
 
The hour hand traces half a degree in one minute. Hence, angle traced by hour hand at 10 hour and 25 minutes = 10×30+ 
2
25
​
 =312.5 
∘
 
Thus, angle between two hands = 312.5−150=162.5 
∘
 
Hence, the reflex angle is = 360−162.5=197.5 
∘
