1.Which statement about the garbage collection mechanism are true?
        A.Garbage collection require additional programe code in cases where 
multiple threads are running.
        B.The programmer can indicate that a referance through a local 
variable is no longer of interest.

the memory used by Java objects.
        D.The garbage collection mechanism can free the memory used by Java 
Object at explection time.

accessible for direct access by any subclasses of  this class, but otherwise 
not by classes which are not  members of the same package. What should be 
done to achieve this?

        E.The variable should be marked private and an  accessor method 
provided
